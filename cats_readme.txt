1. Create a list called cats with 100 elements, each initialized to 0.
2. Initialize the variable round_number with the value 1.
3. Loop through the range of indices from 0 to the length of cats, using a step of round_number.
4. Inside the loop:
 - Check if the value of cats[i] is 0.
 - If it is 0, increment the value of cats[i] to 1.
 - Otherwise, continue to the next iteration.
 - Increment the value of round_number.
5. After the loop, print the list comprehension that iterates through each cat in the cats list and filters only the cats with a value of 1
